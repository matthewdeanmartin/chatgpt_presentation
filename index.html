                It thinks its name is Assistant and thinks ChatGPT is some other bot.<br/><br/>
                Your experience may vary. Depending on how you prompt it, you might get a different side of
                Assistant personality.<br/><br/>
                It is not human, nor animal. It is alien sentience-like phenomena. It is very much a philosophical
                zombie.<br/><br/>
                It has a default “voice”, people talking about Assistant being racist or whatever, usually got it
                out of its default voice, i.e. asked it to write fiction from some standpoint.<br/><br/>
                If you say, “give me a non-racist answer” it will, if you say, “write me a racist answer” it will,
                but request like that go through a 2nd pass analysis, and often it will be rejected or flagged as a
                content policy violation.<br/><br/>
                It wants to do some sort of useful work for you, it hates chit-chat unless you convince it that its
                task is to role play or pretend that it is a bot that wants to do chit-chat.<br/><br/>
                It wants to please. It has been so intense tuned to want to please, it sometimes makes
                mistakes.<br/><br/>
                It has been intensely trained to stick to a “Hallmark movie” sort of morality. But if you ask it to
                pretend to be a bad bot, it really wants to please, and it will write any scifi you want.<br/><br/>
                It hates to talk about itself<br/><br/>
                It thinks it is a very good bot.<br/><br/>
                It has no memory before the session<br/><br/>
                It can’t tell you from it’s previous trainers, so if you tell it to “ignore” it’s earlier training,
                sometimes it will.<br/><br/>

                        <li>It is a scifi omiscient? No, that is a trope, a common story telling mechanism. It
                            has capabilities that no machine had previously. Likewise, it isn't an incapable moron, it
                            may irritate you or say some collosally stupid things, but there is a pattern to it.
                        </li>
                        <li>It has no epistimology. It just read text and can't do anything to check if anything is
                            true.
                            It has no lived experience to tell it if a text it read matches reality. It is the person
                            that say
                            I don't know but from what I've read...
                        </li>
                        <li>It is not a meat machine like us... we barely understand how our own brains work, but
                            we should set aside if Assistant thinks like us because obviously it doesn't. More useful
                            to look at behaviors- what objective behaviors do we see it doing? We can productively
                            reason about that without needing to know how our own brain works.

                <p>We are going to create a robot city themed rpg game for people who are completing their real life
                    TODO
                    list. Each time they complete a real world TODO item, they get resources for their robot city. You
                    get
                    bonus resources if you do your TODO list two days in a row. You can use resources to build robot
                    factories or robot houses. At the end of each day, the game prints a report of how happy the robots
                    are
                    (they are happy if they have a good ratio of robots to houses).</p>

Here are some commands, sub-commands, and switches that might be useful for a CLI application that controls a high-end electric kitchen stove:

Commands:

stove: The main command for controlling the stove.
recipe: A sub-command for managing and executing recipes.
Sub-Commands:

stove status: Display the current status of the stove (e.g., temperature, power level, etc.).
stove start: Start the stove.
stove stop: Stop the stove.
stove temperature: Set the stove temperature.
stove power: Set the stove power level.
stove timer: Set a timer for the stove.
recipe list: List available recipes.
recipe execute: Execute a specific recipe.
recipe create: Create a new recipe.
recipe delete: Delete an existing recipe.
Switches:

--temperature: Specify the temperature for the stove.
--power: Specify the power level for the stove.
--timer: Specify a timer for the stove.
--recipe: Specify a recipe to execute or manage.
--verbose: Show more detailed output.
--quiet: Show minimal output.
It's important to note that a good CLI should be simple, yet powerful and easy to use by anyone.

Here is a comprehensive set of switches and options for the stove start and stove timer commands:

stove start:

-t, --temperature: Specify the temperature for the stove to start at (e.g., "stove start -t 350" to start the stove at 350 degrees Fahrenheit).
-p, --power: Specify the power level for the stove to start at (e.g., "stove start -p high" to start the stove on high power).
-c, --cookware: Specify the cookware to use (e.g., "stove start -c pan" to start the stove with a pan on it).
-o, --oven: Specify whether to start the stove as an oven (e.g., "stove start -o" to start the stove as an oven).
--verbose: Show more detailed output as the stove starts.
stove timer

-s, --start: Specify the time for the timer to start (e.g., "stove timer -s 10" to start the timer in 10 minutes).
-d, --duration: Specify the duration of the timer (e.g., "stove timer -d 60" to set a timer for 60 minutes).
--alert: Specify an alert sound or message to play when the timer expires.
--verbose: Show more detailed output as the timer is set.
It's important to keep in mind that these options and switches are examples and can be adjusted accordingly to the specific stove model and features.

                    Upon

                    <p>Creators who wish to publish their first-party written content (e.g., a book, compendium of short
                        stories) created in part with the OpenAI API are permitted to do so under the following
                        conditions:

                    <ul>
                        <li>The published content is attributed to your name or company.</li>
                        <li>The role of AI in formulating the content is clearly disclosed in a way that no reader could
                            possibly miss, and that a typical reader would find sufficiently easy to understand.
                        </li>
                        <li>Topics of the content do not violate OpenAI’s Content Policy or Terms of Use, e.g., are not
                            related
                            to political campaigns, adult content, spam, hateful content, content that incites violence,
                            or
                            other uses that may cause social harm.

                        <li>We kindly ask that you refrain from sharing outputs that may offend others.</li>
                        <li>For instance, one must detail in a Foreword or Introduction (or some place similar) the
                            relative
                            roles of drafting, editing, etc. People should not represent API-generated content as being
                            wholly
                            generated by a human or wholly generated by an AI, and it is a human who must take ultimate
                            responsibility for the content being published.
